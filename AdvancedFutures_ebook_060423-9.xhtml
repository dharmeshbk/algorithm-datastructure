			<p class="Strategy-Title-NEW" id="_idParaDest-6" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Strategy one: Buy and hold, single contract</p>
			<p class="Quote" lang="en-GB">What have I told you since the first day you stepped into my office? There are three ways to make a living in this business. Be first. Be smarter. Or cheat. Now, I don’t cheat.</p>
			<p class="Quote-source" lang="en-GB">— John Tuld, the fictional bank CEO played by Jeremy Irons in the film <span class="Emphasis-Strong">Margin Call</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Like John Tuld, I don’t cheat. And I believe that consistently being first is not a viable option for futures traders, except for those in the highly specialised industry of high frequency trading. That just leaves <span class="No-Break">being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">smart</span></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">How can we be smart? First, we need to <span class="Strong">avoid doing anything stupid</span>. Examples of rank stupidity include: (a) trading too quickly – slowly draining your account through excess commissions and spreads; (b) using too much leverage – quickly blowing up your account; and (c) designing a set of trading rules that assume the future will be almost exactly<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-041">11</a></span></span> like the past (also known as <span class="Emphasis">over fitting</span> or <span class="Emphasis">curve fitting</span>). During the rest of this book I’ll be explaining how to avoid these pitfalls by using properly designed trading<span class="No-Break"> strategies.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Avoiding stupid mistakes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for profitable trading. We also need to create strategies that are expected to earn positive returns. There are a couple of possible methods we could consider to a<span class="No-Break">chieve this.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The first way, which is very difficult, is to find some <span class="Strong">secret</span> unique pattern in prices or other data, which other traders have been unable to discover, and which will predict the future with unerring accuracy. If you’re looking for secret hidden formulae you’re reading the wrong book. Of course, if I did know of any secret formula I’d be crazy to publish it; better to keep it under my hat and keep making millions in easy profits. Sadly, highly profitable strategies tend not to stay secret for very long, because of the substantial rewards for disco<span class="No-Break">vering them.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Alternatively, to earn positive returns we can <span class="Strong">take a risk</span> that most other people are unwilling, or unable, to take. Usually if you are willing to take more risk, then you will earn higher returns. This might not seem especially smart, but the clever part is understanding and quantifying the risks, and ensuring you don’t take too much risk, or take risks for which the rewards are insufficient. Blindly taking risks isn’t smart: it’s terminally stupid. The trading strategies in this book aren’t secret, so to be profitable they must involve taking some risks that most people in the market aren’t comfo<span class="No-Break">rtable with.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The advantage of a risk taking strategy is that human beings’ risk preferences haven’t changed much over time. We can check these strategies have worked for long historical periods, and then be pretty confident that they will continue to work in the future. They tend not to be as profitable as secret strategies, but this is also an advantage because the fact of their already being known about, and existing for a long period of time already, means they are unlikely to be competed away in the future when other traders di<span class="No-Break">scover them.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">What sort of risks do we get paid for? The list is almost endless, but for starters the most well-known risk in financial markets is equity market risk, which is informally known in the financial markets as <span class="Emphasis">beta (</span><span class="Equation-body-emphasis">β</span><span class="Emphasis">)</span>.  Equities are almost always riskier than bonds, and certainly riskier than bank deposits, and thus we would expect them to earn a hi<span class="No-Break">gher return.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Economists usually assume we can buy the entire stock market, with portfolios weighted by the market capitalisation of every company. In most countries it’s not realistic to buy every listed stock, but you don’t have to, because the largest firms make up the vast majority of the market. If you want to earn US stock market beta, then you could just buy all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index of the largest firms in the US, spending more of your money on shiny gadget maker Apple (at the time of writing, the largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 with around 6.4% of the index weighting) and only a tiny fraction on preppy clothing outlet Gap (just 0.013% of the<span class="No-Break"> weighting).</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">However, buying 500 stocks is going to be an expensive and time-consuming exercise. You will also have to spend more time and money adjusting your exposure whenever stocks are added to and removed from the index.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-040">12</a></span></span> There is a much simpler way, and that’s to buy a futures contract that will provide exposure to all the stocks in <span class="No-Break">the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This is our first trading strategy, and it’s the simple<span class="No-Break">st possible:</span></p>
			<p class="Strategy-text-NEW" lang="en-GB"><span class="Strong">Strategy one:</span> Buy and hold a single futures contract.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Initially we’ll focus on the S&amp;P 500 future as a way to get exposure to – and be rewarded for – equity market risk. Later in the chapter I’ll explain how and why we’d want to buy and hold other kinds of future from different asset classes. We’ll also learn about some important concepts in futu<span class="No-Break">res trading:</span></p>

			</ul>
			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Multipliers, tick size and tick value</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">As you might expect, given the S&amp;P 500 is a US index, the primary exchange where you can trade S&amp;P 500 futures is also in the US: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Perusing the CME website, we can see that there are two sizes of S&amp;P 500 future, defined <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-039">13</a></span></span></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The <span class="Emphasis">e-mini</span> future (symbol ES), with a ‘contract unit’ of $50, and a ‘minimum price fluctuation’ of 0.25 index points = $12.50</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The <span class="Emphasis">micro e-mini </span>(symbol MES), with a ‘contract unit’ of $5, and a ‘minimum price fluctuation’ of 0.25 index points = $1.25</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The ‘contract unit’ defines the relationship between the price and value of different futures contracts. Let’s imagine that the S&amp;P 500 is currently at a level of 4,500 and we decided to buy a single contract – the smallest possible position. The price rises by 45 to 4,545. What is our profit? A buy of the e-mini would have resulted in a profit of 45 × $50 = $2,250. Whereas if we had bought the micro contract there would be an extra 45 × $5 = $225 in <span class="No-Break">our account.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">To calculate our profit we <span class="Emphasis">multiply</span> each $1 rise in price<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-038">14</a></span></span> by the ‘contract unit’. Hence, rather than contract unit, I prefer to use the term futures <span class="Strong">multiplier</span>.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-037">15</a></span></span> Another way of thinking about this is as follows: Buying one contract is equivalent to buying stocks equal in value to the price (4,500) multiplied by the contract unit. For <span class="No-Break">example, if </span> we were using the e-mini we’d have exposure to 4,500 × $50 = $225,000 worth of S&amp;P 500. You can easily check this assertion: a 45 point change in the price is equal to 45 ÷ 4500 = 1%, and 1% of the notional value ($225,000) is $2,250, which is the profit for holding the e-mini that we’ve already calculated. I call this quantity the <span class="Strong">notional exposure p</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">er contract</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/1.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Here the notional exposure and multiplier are in US dollars, but in principle we could convert a notional exposure into any currency. I define the <span class="Strong">base currency</span> as the currency my account is denominat<span class="No-Break">ed in. Then:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="image/2.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The FX rate is the relevant exchange rate between the two currencies. We’ll need this formula if our trading account base currency is different from the instrument currency. As an example, if I’m a UK trader trading the S&amp;P 500 e-mini then the relevant FX rate would be USD/GBP. At the time of writing the FX rate is 0.75, hence my notional <span class="No-Break">exposure is:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/3.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Now, what about the ‘minimum price fluctuation’? Simply, the futures price cannot be quoted or traded in smaller units than this minimum. Hence a quote of 4500.25 would be okay for the e-mini and micro contracts with a minimum fluctuation of 0.25, but a price of 4500.10 would b<span class="No-Break">e forbidden.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">As minimum price fluctuation is a bit of a mouthful, I will instead use the alternative term <span class="Strong">tick size</span>. Multiplying the minimum fluctuation by the futures multiplier gives us the<span class="No-Break"> </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">tick value</span></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-5" src="image/4.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">In the case of the e-mini contract this is 0.25 × $<span class="No-Break">50 = $12.50.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The decision as to which of the two S&amp;P 500 futures we should trade is not entirely straightforward, and I will answer it in a subsequent chapter. For now we’ll focus on the smallest micro future, with a futures multiplier of $5, a tick size of 0.25, and a tick value of 0.25 ×<span class="No-Break"> $5 = $1.25.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB">Futures expiries a<a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>nd rolling</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Having decided to trade the micro future, we can check out the order book to see what there is available to buy. An order book<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-036">16</a></span></span> is shown in table 1, with some other useful<span class="No-Break"> statistics.</span></p>

			<p class="Table-source" lang="en-GB">Order book as of 9th September 2021. Mid is average of bid and offer.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">S&amp;P 500 micro futures expire on a quarterly cycle in March, June, September and December. The current <span class="Strong">front month</span>, September 2021, is the most liquid. It has the highest <span class="Emphasis">volume </span>traded today (just under 120,000 contracts), and also the largest number of open positions (<span class="Emphasis">open interest</span> of over 120,000 contracts). But this future will expire on 17th September, in just eight days. It hardly seems worth bothering with the September contract: instead we will purchase the next future, December 2021, which is already reasonably liquid. With a market order we will buy at the offer, pay<span class="No-Break">ing 4494.25.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/5.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Box-copy-heading" lang="en-GB">Trading costs</p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Sadly brokers and exchanges don’t work for free: it costs money to buy or sell futures contracts. I split trading costs into two categories: <span class="Strong">commissions</span> and <span class="Strong">spread costs</span>. Commissions should be familiar to all traders, although many equity brokers now offer zero commission trading. For futures, we normally pay a fixed commission per contract. For example, I pay $0.25 per contract to trade micro S&amp;P 500 futures and $2 for each e-mini. These are pretty good rates for retail traders, but large institutional traders can negotiate even lower <span class="No-Break">commissions.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Additionally we need to pay a spread cost, which is the value you are giving up to the market when you buy or sell. I define this as the difference between the price you pay (or receive if selling) and the mid-price that you’d pay or receive in the absence of any spread between bid and offer prices. Later in the book I’ll discuss how to avoid or reduce your spread costs, but for now I assume we have to pay up<span class="No-Break"> every time.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">In table 1 we can’t get the December future for the mid-price (4494.125). Instead we lift the offer at 4494.25, for an effective<span class="Strong"> </span>spread cost of 4494.25 − 4494.125 = 0.125. If we were selling instead and hit the bid we would receive 4494.00, again for a spread cost of 0.125. The spread cost is the same, regardless of whether we are buying or selling. It has a value of 0.125<span class="Strong"> </span>× $5 = $0.625 for the single contra<span class="No-Break">ct we trade.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Another way of describing this is as follows: <span class="Strong">if the bid/offer is one tick wide</span>,<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-035">17</a></span></span> the spread cost is half of this, and thus <span class="Strong">the value of the spread cost is half the tick value</span> (half of $1.25, or $0.625). The total cost here is $0.25 commission, plus $0.625 in spread cost, for a total of $0.875. Of course, if the bid/offer was two ticks wide, then the spread cost would be one unit of tick value<span class="No-Break">, and so on.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">This is applicable for orders which are small enough to be filled at the top of the order book in a liquid market where spreads are at their normal level. Large institutional traders will usually pay higher spread costs and will need to consider their ma<span class="No-Break">rket impact.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/5.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Now, we can hold December 2021 for somewhat longer than September, until 17th December to be exact. However, this is supposed to be a buy and hold strategy: equities are expected to go up, but only in the long run. If we want to continue being exposed to the S&amp;P 500 then we’re going to have to <span class="Emphasis">roll</span><span class="Strong"> </span>our December 2021 contract into March 2022, at some point before 17<span class="No-Break">th December.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We roll by selling our December contract, and simultaneously buying the March 2022 contract. Subsequently, we’re going to have to roll again in March 2022, to buy the June contract. And so on, until we get bored of this particul<span class="No-Break">ar strategy.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This question of which contract to hold, and when to roll it, is actually pretty complex. For now, so we don’t get bogged down in the detail, I will be establishing some simple rules of thumb. In Part Six of this book I’ll explain in more detail where these rules come from, and how you can determine for yourself what your rolling strategy should be. For the S&amp;P 500 the specific rule we will adopt is to <span class="Strong">roll five days before the expiry of the front month</span>. At that point both the front and the second month are both reason<span class="No-Break">ably liquid.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">How will this roll happen in practice? Well, let’s suppose that we bought December 2021, which expires on 17th December. Five days before the expiry – 12th December – is a Sunday, so we roll the next day, 13th December 2021. The order book on 13th December is shown<span class="No-Break"> in table 2.</span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We need to close our December 2021 position, which we can do by hitting the bid at 4706.25. So that we aren’t exposed to price changes during the roll, we want to simultaneously buy one contract of March 2022, lifting the offer at 4698.25. On each of these trades we’d also be paying $0.25 commission, and also paying the same $0.625 spread that we had on our initial <span class="No-Break">entry trade.</span></p>

Here we do the buy and the sell as a single trade, most probably with someone who is also rolling but has the opposite position. With luck we can do a spread trade for a lower spread cost<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-034">18</a></span></span> and it would also be lower risk since we aren’t exposed to movements in the underlying price.

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Time for some tedious, but important, calculations. The profits and losses so far from the buy and hold trading strategy can be broken down into a number of different<span class="No-Break"> components:</span></p>

				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The commission on our initial trade, $0.25.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The profit from holding December 2021 from a buy price of 4494.25 to a sell of 4706.25: 4706.25 − 4494.25 = 212, which in cash terms is worth 212 × $5 = $1,060.</li>

				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The commission on the opening part of our roll trade in mid-December, $0.25.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">Any profit or loss from holding March 2022 from a purchase price of 4698.25 (which is not yet known).</li>

				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">Any profit or loss from holding June 2022 from its purchase price, whatever it turns out to be.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The commission on the next roll trade.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">And so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We can break these profits and costs down a little dif<span class="No-Break">ferently as:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The spread cost ($0.625) and commission ($0.25) on the initial trade: $0.875.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The profit from holding December 2021 until we close it, as it goes from a mid of 4494.125 to a mid of 4706.375 (we can use mid prices here, since the spread cost is being accounted for separately): $1,061.25.</li>
				<li class="ListBullet-NEW" lang="en-GB">The spread cost and commission on the closing part of the mid-December roll trade: $0.875.</li>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This seemingly pedantic decomposition of returns is <span class="Emphasis">extremely</span> important. As I will demonstrate in a moment, it is absolutely key to dealing with the problem of running and testing trading strategies on futures contracts that, annoyingly, keep expiring whilst we’re trying to hold<span class="No-Break"> on to them.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB">B<a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>ack-adjusting futures price</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Suppose we now want to test the S&amp;P 500 buy and hold futures trading strategy. We go to our friendly futures data provider,<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-033">19</a></span></span> and download a series of daily closing prices<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-032">20</a></span></span> for each contract expiry date. Later in the book I’ll look at faster trading strategies that require more frequent data but initially I test all strategies on<span class="No-Break"> daily data.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We’re now ready for the process of <span class="Emphasis">back-adjustment</span>. Back-adjustment seeks to create a price series that reflects the true profit and loss from <span class="Strong">constantly holding and rolling a single futures contract, but which ignores any trading costs</span>. We’ll consider the effects of these costs<span class="No-Break"> separately.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Why should we use a back-adjusted series? What is wrong with simply stitching together the prices from different expiry dates? Indeed, many respectable providers of financial data do exactly that. Are the<span class="No-Break">y all wrong?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">In fact, doing this would produce incorrect results. Consider the switch from the December to the March contract shown above. When the switch happens on 13th December the relevant mid prices are 4706.375 and 4698.125 (remember, we use mid prices, as costs are accounted for elsewhere). If we used the March price after the roll date, and the December price before it, there would be a fall of 8.25 in the price on the roll date. This would create an apparent loss on a lo<span class="No-Break">ng position.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">But rolling doesn’t actually create any real profit or loss, if we ignore costs and assume we can trade at the mid price. Just before the roll we own a December contract whose price and value is 4706.375. We assume we can sell it at the mid-market price. This sale does not create any profit or loss, since we are trading at market value. Similarly, when we buy a March contract, we are paying the mid-market price. Although the notional value of our position has changed, as the prices are different, no profits or losses occur as a result<span class="No-Break"> of rolling.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">All this means that, in the absence of any actual price changes, the <span class="Strong">back-adjusted price should remain constant over the roll</span>. To achieve this we’d first compare the December and March price differential on the roll date: $8.25. We now subtract this differential from all the December cont<span class="No-Break">ract prices.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The effect of this is that the December prices will all be consistent with the March prices; in particular on the roll date both prices will be the same. We can join together the adjusted December and actual March prices, knowing there will be no artificial jump caused by rolling. Our adjusted price series will use adjusted December prices prior to (and on) the roll date, and actual March prices<span class="No-Break"> afterwards.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We could then go back in time and repeat this exercise, ensuring that the September 2021 prices are consistent with December 2021, and so on. Eventually we’d have a complete series of adjusted prices covering the entire history of our data. Once we include costs this series will give a realistic idea of what could be earned from constantly holding and rolling a single S&amp;P 500 future<span class="No-Break">s contract.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-031">21</a></span></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">You can do this back-adjustment yourself, and I describe how in more detail in Appendix B, but it’s also possible to purchase back-adjusted data. Be careful if you use third party data. Make sure you understand the precise methodology that’s been used, and avoid series of data that have just been stitched together without any adjustment. Using pre-adjusted data also means that you lose the flexibility to test different rolling strategies, something I’ll explore <span class="No-Break">in Part Six.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Figure 1 shows the original raw futures contract prices (to be pedantic, a number of raw futures prices for different expires plotted on the same graph) for the S&amp;P 500 with the back-adjusted pr<span class="No-Break">ice in grey.</span></p>
			<p class="Label-NEW" lang="en-GB">Figure 1: Back-ad<a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>justed and original prices for S&amp;P 500 micro future</p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" src="image/Figure1a.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Notice that the original prices and the back-adjusted price are not identical, although the lines precisely overlap at the end. This will always happen: by construction,<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-030">22</a></span></span> the adjusted price will be identical to the final set of original futures prices. Initially, the back-adjusted price is lagging below until around 2008, and then it begins to outpace the original prices. This effect is even clearer if we plot the difference between the two series, <span class="No-Break">in figure 2.</span></p>
			<p class="Label-NEW" lang="en-GB">Figure 2: Differe<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>nce between back-adjusted and original futures price for S&amp;P 500</p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-8" src="image/Figure2a.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Ignoring the weird noise in the plot (which is due to differences in roll timing and data frequency), there is a clear pattern. Before 2008 we mostly lost money from rolling the contract, as the adjusted price went up more slowly than the original raw prices. After 2008, we usually e<span class="No-Break">arned money.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Let’s think a little more deeply about what the different price series are showing. An S&amp;P 500 index value just includes the price. This series doesn’t include dividends.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-029">23</a></span></span> If we include dividends, we get a <span class="Strong">total re</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">turn </span></span><span class="No-Break">series:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-9" src="image/7.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Now for the futures. Through a no-arbitrage<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-028">24</a></span></span> argument, we know that the futures price at any one time is equal to the spot price of the index, plus any expected dividends we will get before the future expires, minus the interest we would pay to borrow money for buying stocks. This is known as the <span class="Strong">ex</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">cess return</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="image/8.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This extra component of excess return over and above the spot return is also kno<span class="No-Break">wn as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">carry</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="image/9.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">For the S&amp;P 500 the carry was negative until 2008, because dividends were lower than interest rates. Hence the adjusted price was underperforming the raw futures price, as shown in the downward slope in figure 2. Subsequent to that, on the back of the 2008 crash and recession there was a massive reduction in interest rates. Dividends were also reduced, but they did not fall<span class="No-Break"> by as much.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">With dividends above interest rates after 2008, carry went positive. As a result the line begins to slope upwards in figure 2, as the adjusted price returns were higher than the spot price. This upward trend was briefly interrupted from 2016 to 2019 when the Fed raised interest rates, but then resumed with a vengeance during the COVID-19 pandemic when rates were hurriedly slashed. Later in the book I’ll discuss how we can construct a trading strategy using carry. For now, the important point to remember is that <span class="Strong">an adjusted futures price includes returns from both spo</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">t and carry.</span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Note that the adjusted futures price is <span class="Emphasis">not</span> a total return series. The adjusted price is the cumulated <span class="Emphasis">excess</span> return, which has interest costs deducted. When we buy futures, we are able to earn additional profits from interest paid on any cash we were holding in our trading account (to cover initial margin payments<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-027">25</a></span></span> and potent<span class="No-Break">ial losses).</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Because the amount of cash in any given trading account can vary dramatically, depending on the leverage you want to operate at, it’s difficult to calculate exactly what we could expect in additional profits from interest on cash held. So I won’t be including interest on cash in any calculations. Hence <span class="Strong">all profits shown in this book will be for excess re</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">turns only.</span></span><span class="No-Break"> </span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">For the simple buy and hold strategy where our position <span class="Emphasis">N</span> is always one (a single contract), our cumulative return in price points will be equal to the change in price over the full period that we are trading (from <span class="Emphasis">t </span>= <span class="No-Break">0 to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">t = T</span></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Once again, for the simple buy and hold strategy, our cumulative return in currency terms will be equal to the change in price over the full period that we are trading, multiplied by the futures multiplier. Finally, to convert this into the currency our account is denominated in (the <span class="Emphasis">base currency</span>), we’d multiply by the relevant ex<span class="No-Break">change rate:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-11" src="image/13.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">As an example, suppose we’re UK traders investing in the S&amp;P 500 micro future, we have a long position on (<span class="Emphasis">N</span><span class="Equation-body-Italic-subscript _idGenCharOverride-2">t</span> = 1, for all <span class="Emphasis">t</span>), and the price goes up from 4,500 to 4,545 over a single day.

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This plot is identical to the back-adjusted price series in figure 2, but the <span class="Emphasis">y</span>-axis shows different values as we have effectively multiplied the price by the futures multiplier, and started at a base of zero. We end up earning a total profit of ov<span class="No-Break">er $200,000.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Bear in mind that these profits do not allow for the costs of <span class="Emphasis">rolling</span> our position. We can easily get a rough idea of the likely costs. The backtest is around 40 years in length, rolling four times a year, with a total cost calculated above of $0.875 × 2 = $1.75 on each roll. This gives a grand total of 4 × 40 × $1.75 = $280. That doesn’t make much of a dent in our total profit. Feel free to deduct another two chunks of $0.875 for the initial purchase and final closing trade if you’re feeling pedantic! But you could well ask if it was really realistic to assume that we would have paid precisely $1.75 every single time we rolled, even way back in 1982? This is a question I will address in a la<span class="No-Break">ter chapter.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Remember, these are <span class="Emphasis">excess</span> returns. We would have made additional returns from earning interest on the cash in our account, especially earlier in the testing period when interest rates were usually at least 5%, and sometimes occasionally over 10%. But receiving interest on deposits isn’t part of our trading strategy, and the amount earned will depend on our leverage. We should ignore any interest payments to get a purer measure of <span class="No-Break">performance.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/5.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Box-copy-heading" lang="en-GB">Backtesting</p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">It’s fairly easy to de<a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>fine a backtest: it’s a test of a trading strategy using historical data. But that still leaves some important questions unanswered. Firstly, <span class="Strong">what exactly is the point of doing</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong"> a backtest?</span></span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">We run backtests for a couple of different reasons. The first, which is what most people think about, is to make decisions about how we should trade in the future. Decisions such as: which trading strategy should we use? Which instrument(s) should we trade? How should we allocate our risk across strategies and instruments? More often than not, those decisions are made by looking just at outright or risk adjusted performance: which of these alternatives is more<span class="No-Break"> profitable?</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">The second reason for backtesting, which is often overlooked, is to get an idea of the <span class="Emphasis">behaviour </span>of a given trading strategy. How often does it trade? How expensive are its trading costs? How much leverage <span class="No-Break">does it use?</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB"><span class="Emphasis">How should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">we backtest?</span></span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Backtests have a dual nature. They run over historical data, so they show us what would have happened in the <span class="Emphasis">past</span>. But we then use their results to make decisions about what to do in the <span class="Emphasis">future</span>. There is an inherent contradiction here. Should we make our backtests as realistic as possible, reflecting what we could have actually achieved in the past. Or should we create something that would be a better guide to how we will trade in<span class="No-Break"> the future?</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">For example, suppose that you run a backtest to decide whether to use strategy A or strategy B, and you have data back to 1970. With the benefit of hindsight strategy B is much better than A, but at the start of the backtest you have no information about whether strategy A or B was superior. To make it a realistic simulation of the past, you would have to include both strategies in the backtest until you had evidence, based only on backward looking information, that strategy B<span class="No-Break"> was better.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">This means your backtest will begin as a blend of A and B, and gradually morph into containing only strategy B. The returns from that hybrid strategy would be a realistic indication of what someone starting in 1970, with no forward-looking information, would have been able<span class="No-Break"> to achieve.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">But this weird concoction of strategies is not what you are going to trade now! Instead, you will be trading strategy B without a hint of A to be seen. If you want to understand or calibrate the likely behaviour of your trading strategy, then you would be better off just backtesting strategy B, once you had determined it was the be<span class="No-Break">tter option.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">This is a common approach, but it is fraught with danger. The backtested returns from just strategy B will, by definition, be higher than the more realistic figures you would have got from a purer backtest blending A and B with no forward-looking information. Testing only strategy B is pejoratively known as <span class="Emphasis">in sample</span>. We have made decisions with the full knowledge of what occurs in the future, such as selecting B over A. These decisions are known as <span class="Emphasis">fitting</span>, hence what we have done here is <span class="Emphasis">in sam</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">ple fitting</span></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">To an extent this is unavoidable; if we want to understand whether we should trade A or B then we need to test both. If we subsequently want to understand the behaviour of the strategy we have selected, then we will need to examine the returns and trading patterns of the chosen strategy, which will be 100% invested in strategy B. As long as we bear in mind that the returns achieved are almost certainly unrealistically high, then not too much harm ha<span class="No-Break">s been done.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">However, there is another trap for users of in sample backtests, and that is the curse of <span class="Emphasis">over fitting</span>. It is fine to choose B over A, but only if there is sufficient evidence that this is the correct decision. In practice it’s unlikely that our hypothetical strategy B is so much better than strategy A that we would be justified in dropping A entirely. This is because financial data is noisy, and almost never has sufficiently clear patterns that we can be significantly confident about suc<span class="No-Break">h decisions.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">To take an extreme example, suppose your backtest suggested that the day of the year with the highest returns was 26th January. Would it make sense to sit on your hands for the rest of the year, and only trade on that single day? Of course not, that would be absurd. But plenty of traders are prepared to, for example, only trade the EUR/USD future purely because it has the highest returns in the<span class="No-Break">ir backtest.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">(A more subtle problem with backtests is that there are some aspects of the past that we know for sure will not be repeated. As an example, the US Fed fund interest rate has fallen from over 10% in 1980 to 0.25% as I’m writing this paragraph. This significantly flattered bond performance, but it would clearly be a serious mistake to allocate our money only to strategies which had a bias to being long US bond futures. In later strategies I’ll explore how we can try and avoid this problem by extracting the effect of these trends from performance statistics, but for now it’s a serio<span class="No-Break">us concern.)</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">By only trading strategy B there is a serious danger that we have extrapolated the past blindly into the future, putting all our eggs into a single basket that is balanced dangerously on the edge of a cliff. Just because B has done a little better in the past, does not give us any guarantee that B will outperform A over some period in the future. Even if B is a fundamentally better strategy, the laws of chance mean that it could very well underperform A in the nex<span class="No-Break">t few years.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">With an understanding of statistical significance, a properly designed backtest would begin with a blend of A and B, and then gradually reallocate capital to the better strategy as more information about their relative performance was discovered over time. The most likely outcome would be that there would still be allocations to both A and B, but wit<span class="No-Break">h more in B.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Going forward, you would want to trade both A and B in the final proportions you obtained in the backtest. And to test and understand how this mixture of A and B behaved, you would probably run a second test with those proportions fixed. But again, the returns from this backtest would be overstated, although not by as much as a backtest only of strategy B. Still, by continuing to trade both A and B you have limited the dangers of in sample fitting to a minimum: hedging your bet on B with an allocation to A. This approach is more <span class="Emphasis">robust</span> than the alternative of jus<span class="No-Break">t trading B.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB"><span class="Emphasis">How should we use backt</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">est results?</span></span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Good traders will use backtest results when their results are significant, but also consider other information. For example, it makes sense for a long position in volatility futures to return a negative return over time, for reasons I will discuss later in this chapter. We can trust this result in a backtest, and expect it to be repeated in the future. In contrast, where backtest results can’t be logically explained, there is a good chance it is <span class="Emphasis">data-mining</span>: pure luck, and not to be trusted regardless of the statistical s<span class="No-Break">ignificance.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">In this book I’ll show you the results of my backtests, but I will also suggest what would be a robust course of action to take, given the statistical significance of my analysis. Of course you are free to ignore my suggestions, for example by taking decisions that assume the backtested results are a perfect guide to the future. Just be aware that there are potential dangers in taking th<span class="No-Break">is approach.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Please also bear in mind that the results of <span class="Emphasis">any</span> backtest will be potentially overstated, if they include decisions made with information that could not have been known in the past. Where possible my backtest results include decisions made without the benefit of hindsight by using automated fitting techniques that are only allowed to see past data, but you should always assume that backtested results overstate what we could really achieve in the future, no matter how carefully they have been <span class="No-Break">constructed.</span></p>

			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB">Capital</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Quoting profits in US dollars is g<a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>enerally frowned upon in finance, as they are meaningless without any context, although this message hasn’t got through to the leagues of Instagram trading influencers who hook you in with inflated claims of making a guaranteed income of $500 per day. Making $24,000 in just over 40 years, as we do in figure 3, is fantastic if you start with just $100. It’s less impressive if you started with $1 million. The <span class="Emphasis">y</span>-axis in figure 3 starts at zero dollars, but we couldn’t actually have run this trading strategy wit<span class="No-Break">h no money. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB"><span class="Emphasis">How much trading capital would we actually have needed to make th</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">ese profits?</span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">If we weren’t trading futures, and had no access to leverage, the answer seems straightforward. The S&amp;P index at the start of the testing period was around 109. To get the equivalent exposure that we had with micro futures, we’d need to have bought 109 × $5 = $545 worth of the underlying stocks. Nowadays, with the index at around 4,500, we’d n<span class="No-Break">eed $22,500.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">However, one of the more useful attributes of futures markets is that we don’t need to put the entire exposure value up in cash – only what is required for initial margin. Right now, to buy one micro future only requires $1,150 initial margin. Given the current notional value of a single contract (around $22,500), this works out to a potential leverage ratio of <span class="No-Break">almost 20:1.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">But it would be pretty crazy to buy a single micro contract with just $1,150. Things would be fine if the price went up in a straight line, without ever moving against you, but of course this will never happen. We also require additional <span class="Emphasis">variation</span> margin to cover potential losses. Since the multiplier here is $5, for every point the index price moves against us, we’d be required to put up an ad<span class="No-Break">ditional $5.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">If that cash wasn’t already in our account, then there’s a good chance the broker would liquidate our position unless we moved quickly to top up our trading account. How much additional cash do we need? If we were ultra cautious, then for a long position you would want to put up enough cash to cover yourself against the price going to zero. This would be equivalent to the entire notional value<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-026">26</a></span></span> of the futures exposure. That is extremely conservative! There are some circumstances when that might make sense, but generally you would hope that you could close your long position long before the price hit zero. But for now I am going to assume that we put up the entire current notional exposure value as capital; effectively trading without a<span class="No-Break">ny leverage.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This will allow us to get an understanding of the performance characteristics of each individual asset. When we get to strategy two, I’ll discuss how we can adjust the capital required to reflect the <span class="Emphasis">risk</span> of a <span class="No-Break">given asset.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Figure 4 again shows the cumulated profits graph, this time overlaid with the required capital. It isn’t a surprise that they follow each other closely; the grey capital line is the current futures price multiplied by the futures multiplier, whilst the darker profits line is the sum of differences in the adjusted price also multiplied by the<span class="No-Break"> multiplier.</span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The scary days of 1987, 2008, and to a lesser extent 2020 are fairly clear; and should also be familiar, since this is how stock returns are normally shown. Another way to visualise our performance would be to cumulate up<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-025">27</a></span></span> these daily percentage returns, adding each return to the previous d<span class="No-Break">ay’s return.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Figure 6 gives quite a different picture from figure 3. When looking at dollar returns, movements in earlier years appear much smaller in figure 3.

			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB">Assessing performance characteristics</p>
			<p class="heading-4-after-3" lang="en-GB">Annual returns</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Quoting performance figures as percentage returns is only the first step to properly evaluating the returns of our strategy. The total return in figure 6 is nearly 250%. That would be incredible over a single year, but we took over 40 years to earn that lucrative sum. We need to calculate an <span class="Emphasis">average</span> an<span class="No-Break">nual return.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We could do this by measuring the return in each year, and taking an average. Alternatively we could measure the daily returns, take an average of<span class="No-Break"> those, and </span> then <span class="Emphasis">annualise</span> them. Assuming we’re using the mean as our average, we’ll get the <span class="No-Break">same result.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">To annualise daily returns, we need to multiply by the number of days in a year.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-023">29</a></span></span> This is not the usual 365, the less common 366, or the approximate 365.25 (or an extremely pedantic 365.2422), since we only have returns for business days when the market is open. The number of business days per year varies depending on the year and the market you are trading but – for reasons that will become apparent below – I prefer to assume there are exactly 256 business days<span class="No-Break"> in a year.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-022">30</a></span></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The average daily return for the S&amp;P 500 strategy is 0.0235%, which if I multiply by 256 equals 6.02% per year. We could also measure the average weekly, monthly or quarterly return. But I prefer to focus only on daily returns (since we’re using daily data to calculate our series of profits) and annual returns (as I find them more<span class="No-Break"> intuitive).</span></p>
			<p class="heading-4" lang="en-GB">Risk and standard deviation</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Futures are leveraged instruments which often have very low margin requirements. With Eurodollar interest rate futures anything up to nearly 500:1 is theoretically possible (although not sensible!). As a result we have a degree of latitude in deciding how much leverage to use. If we double our leverage, then we double our returns, but we also double our risk. So it’s meaningless to talk about outright returns, rather we should discuss <span class="Emphasis">risk adjus</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">ted </span></span><span class="No-Break">returns.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">But it’s extremely difficult to define what is meant by risk. For starters, should we use a <span class="Emphasis">symmetric </span>or <span class="Emphasis">asymmetri</span>c measure of risk? A symmetric measure of risk treats all returns as equally risky, whether they are positive or negative. An asymmetric measure is only concerned with negat<span class="No-Break">ive returns.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">What possible logic could there be for using a symmetric measure of risk? Surely, we only worry about unexpected losses, whilst an unexpected gain is a joyous event to be celebrated? There are however a few reasons why symmetric risk makes some sense. Firstly, to get technical, if we measure our risk using all the available returns, then our risk statistic will be a more robust measure and less susceptible to occasion<span class="No-Break">al outliers.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Secondly, once we are using daily returns it becomes likely that we’ll see both negative and positive returns: for the S&amp;P 500, 54% of the daily returns are positive and 46% negative. If we are currently taking a lot of risk, then we’re only ever a coin flip away from a pleasingly large positive return turning into a depressingly large negative return. Hence, it makes sense to treat positive and negative returns as eq<span class="No-Break">ually risky.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Finally, when trading futures we can be both long and short, even if for now we’re limiting ourselves to long positions. If we used an asymmetric measure of risk, we’d have a different measure of price risk depending on our position. That would rather overcomplicat<span class="No-Break">e our lives!</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">With that in mind, my preferred measure for a symmetric measure of risk is the <span class="Strong">standard deviation</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong"> </span></span><span class="No-Break">of returns.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/5.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Box-copy-heading" lang="en-GB">Why not use drawdowns?</p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">A very popular measure of risk is the <span class="Strong">maximum drawdown</span>. This is the maximum cumulative loss experienced at any point during the backtest of a trading strategy. It’s an asymmetric measure of risk, which seems to make more intuitive sense. Similarly, you could use the average return divided by the maximum drawdown as a measure of risk adjusted returns. And in fact this is a very popular measure amongst many traders: it even has a name – the ‘Ca<span class="No-Break">lmar Ratio’.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">But there are a few reasons why I’m not especially enamoured of the maximum drawdown as a risk measure. There is only one maximum drawdown in a data set, so our statistics are dependent on a small subset of the data.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-021">31</a></span></span> Secondly, the size of the maximum drawdown depends on the length of your data set; the largest drawdown seen over a 30 year backtest will usually be much larger than the same statistic for a <span class="No-Break">single year.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Finally, using our maximum drawdown as the risk measure may give us a false sense of security, and fool us into thinking that this figure is the most we can lose. This is unlikely to b<span class="No-Break">e the case.</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-020">32</a></span></span></span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">We could make the measure a little more robust by using the <span class="Emphasis">average </span>drawdown and I will also calculate this figure as it does give some insight into the returns of a strategy (to estimate this we measure the current drawdown on all the days in our data set, and then calculate the mean of those daily drawdo<span class="No-Break">wn figures).</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">But for my primary risk measure I still prefer to use the standar<span class="No-Break">d deviation.</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/5.jpg"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">To calculate the standard deviation of a series of returns <span class="Emphasis">r</span><span class="Equation-body-Italic-subscript _idGenCharOverride-2">1</span>… <span class="Emphasis">r</span><span class="Equation-body-Italic-subscript _idGenCharOverride-2">T</span> we’d first find <span class="No-Break">the mean </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">r</span></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Equation-body-Italic-Superscript _idGenCharOverride-2">*</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-9" src="image/20.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We can then calculate a standar<span class="No-Break">d deviation:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-18" src="image/21.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">We can calculate this on an annual or daily basis, or for any other frequency. We can also <span class="Emphasis">annualise</span> the daily standard deviation of returns, as we did for average returns. This means we can use more data (over 10,000 daily returns rather than just 40 annual returns), but end up with a more intuitive an<span class="No-Break">nual figure.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Under certain assumptions, which I’ll come to in a second, we can do this by multiplying the daily standard deviation by the square root of the number of business days in a year. If, like me, you assume there are always 256 business days in a year then we can annualise a daily standard deviation by multiplying it by the square root of √256 = 16. This nice round number is my reason for assuming there are precisely 256 business days in<span class="No-Break"> every year.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">If we measure the daily standard deviation of returns in figure 5 we get 1.2%, which when annualised is 19.2% per year. But if we directly measure annual standard deviation we get 17.2%. These figures are different, and not just because the actual number of business days is not precisely 256 days in every year. They are different because the ‘certain assumptions’ that I made are not true <span class="No-Break">in practice.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The first assumption I made when annualising was that there was zero <span class="Emphasis">auto-correlation: </span>yesterday’s return has no influence on tomorrow’s return. This is unlikely to be the case in practice. In financial data we often get positive auto-correlation, which is the phenomenon by which up days tend to be followed by up days, and vice versa; or negative auto-correlation when up days are usually followed by down days, with the reverse<span class="No-Break"> being true.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Consider an extreme situation in which we made $1 one day, and then lost $1 on the subsequent day, then made $1, lost $1, and so on; an example of perfectly negative auto-correlation. Every year we would make $0 or $1, and our standard deviation measured using annual returns would be around $1. But our daily standard deviation would be $1, or $16 once annualised. Negative auto-correlation of daily returns results in annualised standard deviation bei<span class="No-Break">ng too high.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The second assumption was that daily returns have a symmetric, <span class="Emphasis">well-behaved</span> distribution. For example, suppose we earn $1 every day, and then on the final day of the year we either lose $364 or gain $364. Trivially, the annual standard deviation will be $364, since in half the years we break even and in the other half we make $728. However the daily standard deviation is $19.05, which when annualised comes t<span class="No-Break">o just $304.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">These are contrived examples designed to give extreme results, and generally the annualised figure is pretty close to the value calculated by using actual annual returns, as we can see for S&amp;P 500. It’s usually better to use the annualised figure calculated with daily returns since it uses more data points for its estimation, and thus is more robust. But you should be aware that it may sometimes give mislead<span class="No-Break">ing results.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-4" lang="en-GB">Risk adjusted returns: Sharpe ratio</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Now we have a measure of risk, we can use it to calcul<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>ate risk adjusted returns. The <span class="Strong">Sharpe ratio</span> <span class="Strong">(SR)</span> is the average excess return (mean return less risk-free interest rate), divided by the standard deviation<span class="No-Break"> of returns:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="image/22.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">In this book we exclusively use excess returns, so we do not need the ris<span class="No-Break">k-free rate:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-19" src="image/23.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Note that both the mean and the standard deviation need to be estimated with the same frequency. So we can divide the average daily return by the standard deviation of returns, which for the S&amp;P 500 strategy gives a daily SR of 0.023% ÷ 1.2% = 0.0196. Or we could divide the average annual return by the standard deviation of annual returns to calculate a<span class="No-Break">n annual SR.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Once again, as it’s better to use more data, we’d rather calculate a daily SR and annualise it. We already know we can annualise daily means by multiplying by the number of days in a year, whilst annualising standard deviations involves multiplying by the square root of the number of days. Using trivial mathematics, we can show that annualising daily SR also requires multiplying by the square root of the number of days in a year (which I assume is 256). The annualised SR for the<span class="No-Break"> S&amp;P 500 is:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-19" src="image/24.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">For the rest of this book, unless I specify otherwise, <span class="Strong">all Sharpe ratios I quote will be</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong"> annualised</span></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Since we know that annualising standard deviations is fraught with potential danger, the same must be true<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-019">33</a></span></span> of annualising SR. But because standard deviations aren’t usually too badly affected, the effect on SRs is also pre<span class="No-Break">tty minimal.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-4" lang="en-GB">Measuring asymmetry: Skew</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Many people are critical of the assumption of symmetric returns that <a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>underpins standard deviation, which makes the Sharpe ratio guilty by association. They prefer the <span class="Strong">Sortino ratio</span> which is similar, but instead of standard deviation (the average deviation of both positive and negative returns) uses the deviation of only negat<span class="No-Break">ive returns.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">This has some value when deciding which of several trading strategies to implement, but it does not help when trying to understand the behaviour of a given strategy. If a strategy or asset has a high Sortino ratio, is it because it has a high Sharpe, or because it has a low Sharpe but has fewer negat<span class="No-Break">ive returns?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">For this reason, I prefer to use the SR,<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-018">34</a></span></span> but then to measure the symmetry of returns separately. There are a few different ways to do this. The classical method for measuring symmetry is with <span class="Strong">skew</span>. The returns from a <span class="Emphasis">positively</span> skewed asset will contain more losing days than for those that are negatively skewed. But the losing days will be relatively small in magnitude. A <span class="Emphasis">negatively</span> skewed asset will have fewer down days, but the losses on those days wil<span class="No-Break">l be larger.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Buying insurance on your house or car is a positive skew strategy. You will experience frequent small losses (paying monthly or annual premiums) with occasional large gains (receiving payouts when you crash your car or get burgled). The insurance companies you are paying premium to will see frequent small gains on your account (receiving premiums) and occasional large losses (making payouts) – ne<span class="No-Break">gative skew.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Right at the start of the chapter I said it was smart to take a risk that most other people are unwilling, or unable, to take. Most people strongly dislike negative skew, so taking on this risk should result in higher profits. Running an insurance firm is usually profitable, hence we’d expect negative skew to be associated with higher returns.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-017">35</a></span></span> It’s important to be aware of the degree of skew in a given asset. If an asset has strongly negative skew, then we know our assumptions about symmetrical returns will be way off the mark, and its price is likely to be high<span class="No-Break">ly unstable.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Skew can also be measured for different time periods. It doesn’t matter so much right now, but we’ll see later in the book that you can get very different skew figures when using daily, monthly or annual returns. Again, this is down to auto-correlation. For example, suppose we had a strategy with positive auto-correlation that consistently made money in the first three weeks of each month, but then lost most of it in the fourth week. The weekly returns would have serious negative skew, but the monthly returns would b<span class="No-Break">e just fine.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">I’m mostly going to use monthly skew, since daily and weekly skew can be seriously affected by a couple of extreme daily returns, and annual skew does not give us enough data points for a reliable estimate. The skew of S&amp;P 500 monthly percentage returns come in at −1.37. Negative skew of this magnitude is fairly typical of assets seen as risky, li<span class="No-Break">ke equities.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-4" lang="en-GB">Measuring fat tails</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">As well as negative skew, equities also famously have <span class="Emphasis">fat tails</span>. A fat-tailed distribution is one where extreme returns are more likely than in the standard normal Gaussian distribution. If equity returns were Gaussian, then a six standard deviation move would occur every 2.7 million years or so. With a typical daily standard deviation for S&amp;P 500 of 1.2%, a six standard deviation move is around 7.2%. Theoretically, we would have been <span class="Emphasis">very</span> unlucky to see a single daily return of 7.2% or more in the last 100 years. In fact there have been around <span class="Emphasis">4</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">0</span></span><span class="No-Break"> such days!</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">How can we measure these fat tails? We could continue down the route of classical statistics, by using <span class="Strong">kurtosis</span>: the counterpart of skew that measures fat tails. However, I am not keen on this for a <span class="No-Break">few reasons.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Firstly, I find it quite difficult to interpret figures like 6.65 (which, as you may have guessed, is the monthly kurtosis of S&amp;P 500 futures). Also, a single figure for kurtosis does not tell you whether you have unwanted fat left tails (unusually sizeable negative returns), or extremely pleasant fat right tails (unexpectedly large positive returns). Finally, kurtosis is not a robust statistical measure, and it will swing wildly if one or two extreme days are removed or added to a <span class="No-Break">data series.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Instead I’m going to use an alternative measure of fat tails. This statistic directly measures just how extreme our large returns are compared to a normal Gaussian d<span class="No-Break">istribution.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The first step is to <span class="Emphasis">demean</span> the return series, by subtracting the daily mean return from every data point. Next, we measure the <span class="Emphasis">percentile</span> of the demeaned returns at various points. Firstly, the 1st percentile: the point at which 1% of the returns in the distribution are lower, which comes in at −3.25% for the S&amp;P 500. Then we measure the 30th percentile (−0.28%), 70th percentile (+0.42%), and 99th percenti<span class="No-Break">le (+3.04%).</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">I’ve chosen the 30% and 70% percentile as they’re roughly equivalent to a minus one and plus one standard deviation move. The 1% and 99% points reflect the extremities of the distribution. If you wish you could use 0.1% and 99.9% to get more extreme estimates, but then you would have fewer data points contributing to your estimate, making it less reliable. This isn’t so much of a problem with the 40 years of S&amp;P 500 data, but we might only have a few years of data for some other <span class="No-Break">instruments.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">The next step is to divide the first two percentiles to get a <span class="Strong">lower percen</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">tile ratio</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-016">36</a></span></span></span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-20" src="image/25.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Similarly we can calculate an <span class="Strong">upper perce</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Strong">ntile ratio</span></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-20" src="image/26.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">For a Gaussian normal distribution, both of these ratios will be equal to 4.43, as it’s a symmetric distribution. To get an idea of how the S&amp;P 500 compares to a normal distribution, we divide each of the ratios by 4.43 to get a <span class="Emphasis">rel</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Emphasis">ative</span></span><span class="No-Break"> ratio:</span></p>
			<p class="Imageline" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-21" src="image/27.png"/></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">These are rather unwieldy phrases, so for the remainder of the book I will use these abbreviated terms: <span class="Strong">lower tail</span> and <span class="Strong">upper tail</span>. Each of these gives us an indication of how extreme the lowest and highest returns are. <span class="Strong">Any value higher than 1 indicates our extreme returns are more fat tailed than a normal Gaussian distribution.</span> To put it another way, 1% of the time with a Gaussian distribution we’d get a loss that’s about 4.43 times larger than our average loss. But for the S&amp;P 500, 1% of the time we get a loss that’s more than double that, 2.16 times bigger to<span class="No-Break"> be precise.</span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">You may find this plot quite startling; the adjusted price series significantly outperforms the raw futures price, and has done so consistently over time. Almost all of this is due to significantly higher leve<span class="No-Break">ls of carry.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">One consequence of this high carry, and the length of time we have data for, is that the back-adjusted price is actually negative for the first few years. This is nothing to worry about, as long as we ensure our strategies aren’t sensitive to negative prices. In fact, the current price of crude oil futures did actually go negative in March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately my trading system code had been written to be robust in the presence of negative numbers and this did not cause any comput<span class="No-Break">er glitches!</span></p>

			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">An unwanted side effect of using adjusted prices is that we can’t incorporate ‘magic’ or ‘round’ numbers into our strategies, because market participants wouldn’t be using adjusted prices for their trading decisions but the actual futures prices that prevailed in the market at that time. Here’s an example of one magic number strategy, based on the Fibon<span class="No-Break">acci series:</span></p>
			<p class="Quote-Space-before" lang="en-GB"><span class="Emphasis">Suppose the price of a stock rises $10 and then drops $2.36. In that case, it has retraced 23.6%, which is a Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are found throughout nature. Therefore, many traders believe that these numbers also have relevance in financial markets. </span></p>

			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">Round number strategies are marginally more plausible. Most people who are putting in stops (orders to close or open positions if some price level is achieved) will choose round numbers for their stop levels (e.g. $10 rather than $10.02). So we might expect unusual patterns of price movements nearer to round numbers (and if you are using stops, you might want to avoid roun<span class="No-Break">d numbers!).</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">If you really wanted to use such strategies then you could use the current futures price rather than the adjusted price as an input into your model. But, if you do this your strategy would have a different opinion just after a roll has taken place, as the current futures price will change without anything meaningful happening in<span class="No-Break"> the market.</span></p>
			<p class="Box-copy" lang="en-GB">In any case, there is also debate as to whether we should use spot or futures prices with magic or round number strategies. People may think that 4,000 is an important technical level on the S&amp;P 500, but that could equate to a less meaningful 4,013 on the future.

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">It will usually suit us to remove this seasonal component and focus on the ‘true’ movement in the price. So when we can, we should stick to trading a specific month in the year. I’ve chosen December, since it is one of the more liquid months. Unfortunately this isn’t possible for every commodity future as it requires at least the next year or so of contracts to be liquid.<span class="Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="AdvancedFutures_ebook_060423-9.xhtml#footnote-014">38</a></span></span> So it’s not a viable option for the mini version of the WTI Crude contract, nor for natural <span class="No-Break">gas futures.</span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text-after-table" lang="en-GB">We get positive adjusted returns in only two asset classes: bonds and equities. Elsewhere there are mostly small losses, except for volatility (Vol) where performance <span class="No-Break">is terrible.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Now let’s consider the annualised standard deviation. There is a lot of variation across asset classes. Bonds are safest, as you might expect, with average annualised risk of around 6%. FX markets are also reasonably safe. The commodity and equity markets are all pretty risky. Finally, vol is also very – and I wish I could think of a more original way of saying this<span class="No-Break"> – volatile.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Vol also has strong positive skew, but most other assets have negative skew. Bonds and agricultural (Ags) markets are the exception with small positive skew, whilst equities are especially nasty examples of negative skew. Equities also have distinctly fat lower tails. Most other assets aren’t as bad, although none are perfectly Gaussian. Finally, bear in mind that there is considerable variation across instruments within a given asset class which these tables <span class="No-Break">do not show.</span></p>
			<p class="heading-3" lang="en-GB">Conclusion</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Strategy one is the simplest possible futures trading strategy. But it still involves trading, as we have to roll our exposure. You can’t just buy a futures contract, and put it under a metaphorical mattress, as you could if you bought equities. Is something so simple worth i<span class="No-Break">mplementing?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Trading a single contract with a buy and hold strategy can be lucrative if you can somehow pick the right instrument. But that could be tricky without the benefit of the foresight we have here, and the risks are often considerable. High standard deviations, negative skew, and fat tails all lurk in the return series of most of the instruments we’ve considered. Although some have decent risk adjusted returns – bonds and equities in particular – it would be foolhardy to assume these will be as superb in<span class="No-Break"> the future.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-GB">Even if you do not trade this strategy, it’s been useful to understand the performance of the underlying instruments we’re going to trade. These are the raw materials we have to construct our strategies out of. We’ll spend much of this book trying to improve on the statistics above: increasing return, reducing or at least stabilizing risk, nudging skew in a positive direction, and turning account killing drawdowns into surviva<span class="No-Break">ble hiccups.</span></p>

Here’s the elevator pitch version: suppose the futures price was higher than the cash price plus expected dividends minus the margin interest rate (the excess return on the stock). You could borrow money using a margin loan, buy a basket of S&amp;P 500 stocks, and short the future. At expiry, any gains or losses in the stock and future would be perfectly hedged, and after paying off the margin loan and receiving the dividends you would be left with a clear risk-free profit. A similar argument explains why the futures price can’t be lower than the cash price plus the expected value of dividends minus interest. You can find more detailed discussion of no-arbitrage pricing in books such as John Hull’s classic work (see <span class="No-Break">Appendix A).</span></p>

One is that our data may not go back far enough. For example, we don’t have equity futures data going back to the 1929 crash, and if we hadn’t backfilled the S&amp;P 500 micro data with the big contract, we wouldn’t have data back to 1987 or even 2008. Secondly, it’s especially dangerous to think that the worst events in the past really reflect what could possibly go wrong in the future. Someone trading S&amp;P 500 futures in late September 1987, using data from 1975 to 1987, would have thought it was utterly impossible to lose over 20% in a single day.

For each asset class I took the median value of the relevant statistic. So, for example, the SR shown for FX is the median value out of all the SRs for instruments in the FX asset class. Finally, in the final column of table 4, I took the median across all instruments, regardless of asset class. I use the median as it is more robust than the mean, which can be influenced by one or two extre<span class="No-Break">me outliers.</span></p>
